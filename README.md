# 📊 SIEM Management Lab – Log Analysis & Threat Detection Framework

This repository kickstarts a hands-on exploration of **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** using open-source and commercial tools. Designed for cybersecurity learners and professionals, this project emphasizes building detection logic, visualizing security telemetry, and simulating incident workflows in a controlled environment.

## 🚀 Lab Objectives (Setup Phase)

- Deploy and configure a SIEM solution (e.g., Wazuh, Splunk Free)
- Define data sources: Windows event logs, firewall logs, system telemetry
- Explore rule creation, alerting mechanisms, and log retention policies
- Prepare incident response templates and documentation formats

## 🛡️ Ethical Disclaimer

This lab is strictly for **educational and professional development**. All data sources are simulated or consented test environments. No production systems or unauthorized networks are involved. The goal is to demonstrate responsible detection engineering practices.
